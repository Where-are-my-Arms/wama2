TODO:

* don't render balls on ceiling or floor
* render balls on a grid to prevent overlap, check to make sure ball is rendered in empty grid spot
* add 'color checking' for the ball that is touched
* add reaction for balls touched -- color should change, maybe a sound plays, ball disappears
* show time running out
* right now controllers change color to show the 'target color' -- should it stay like this, or something else?
* visual improvements
* start game button
* show score at end
* add tick-tock back ground sound?
